# Autonomous Driving Agents with Reinforcement Learning ðŸš—

This repository showcases end-to-end implementation of RL agents for autonomous driving simulation using [Highway-Env](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env). Three algorithmsâ€”DQN, PPO, and A2Câ€”were used with training, evaluation, and video logging.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Environment: `highway-fast-v0` from `highway-env`
- Algorithms: DQN, PPO, A2C (Stable-Baselines3)
- Tools: Gymnasium, OpenCV, TensorBoard
- Features: Model saving, video rendering, reward logging
